# Day 4 - Class Components

# Class Components

## Class Component

1. Have a name starting with a capital letter.
2. Extend React.Component.
3. Have a `render()` method that returns a React Element either by JSX or `React.createElement()`. Below, we are using JSX.

```js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
    
    
class SomeClassComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return <div>This is our first class component.</div>;
    }
}
    
export default SomeClassComponent;
```
